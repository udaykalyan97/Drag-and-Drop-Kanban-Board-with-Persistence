Drag-and-Drop Kanban Board with Persistence
Problem: Build a Trello-like Kanban board with columns and draggable tasks.
Requirements:
Use react-beautiful-dnd or implement basic drag-and-drop manually.


Save board state to localStorage or persist to a mock API.


Optimistic UI updates with rollback on API failure.
